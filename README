I just want to integrate Peachpayment payment gateway into the Web, iOS and Android version of the flutter application.
https://peachpayments.docs.oppwa.com/

To access Firebase for the application you can use the following credentials 
inglenookapp@gmail.com
Password: inglenook@)@1

For the webpage you can email me at osamah7991@gmail.com and I will send you the hosting site credentials 

We want to host both the user application and the admin application on all three platforms. 
Lastly, we want to be able to log all the order to an excel file and print them (This feature is missing from the exisiting applicaiton)
